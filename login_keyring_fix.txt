Resetting everything (delete all passwords and start new keyring):

rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring
Or

Navigate to Places > Home. Press Ctrl + H to view "hidden files". Navigate to .local > share > keyrings and delete login.keyring

Using the same keyring (resetting keyring password but keeping old passwords in keyring):

Make a backup of the keyring

cd ~/.local/share/keyrings/
cp login.keyring login.keyring.backup
and after that delete login.keyring file

rm ~/.local/share/keyrings/login.keyring
Create a new keyring file from Gnome Keyring with the name login
type= touch login.keyring

Replace the new keyring file with the backup of the old keyring file

cd ~/.local/share/keyrings/
mv login.keyring.backup login.keyring      
Note: before Ubuntu 12.10 the path to the keyrings folder was ~/.gnome2/keyrings/ instead of ~/.local/share/keyrings/.



TO CHANGE the password in the git config---->
type sudo git config --global --edit
change the user name and password
