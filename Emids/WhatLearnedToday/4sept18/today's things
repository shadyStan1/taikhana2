.Changes in Exemplar

We cant add a new function directly into exemplar.
In this case we a create an interface inside exemplar with a default method without implementation.
Then we create an implementation class in the UHG side for the interface. 
***there should be a <bean> tag for the interface and its implementation class inside applicationContext.xml
***with the same id.
then call this implemented method from the exemplar side


.Creating entity class in the uhg-side

create entity class for a table
add join relationship with the tables having foreign key columns
***take care if the related column is primary key in other table 
***then relationship is @OneToOne
***else @OneToMany

.for deletion of rows
take care about the updatable attribute in @JoinColumn
***put updatable = false because we dont give the related table the power to update the column in the main table
