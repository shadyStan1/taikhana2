Install git on system-
sudo apt-get install git

setup your username on git in the system-
git config--global user.name"shadyStan1"

setup your email on git in your system-
git config--global user.email"amaniverma04@gmail.com"

then you can create a repositry over the github by visiting the website.

Step1.
echo "# taikhana2" >> README.md

Step2.initialise the git(means telling the local machine it is a git directory)-------------->
type -> git init


to create a new file-
type-> nano "file-name.extension"

type content inside the file created
to save type-> ctrl + 'O' + Enter

to exit 
type-> ctrl + 'X'

to read file->
nano "file-name"

General step to add a file to git(STAGING)------>history
git add README.md

add a commit------>
 type -> git commit -m "first commit"


connect to a remote repositry from local git repository(where to push the file)***NOT NEEDED EVERYTIME------->
  type-> git remote add origin https://github.com/shadyStan1/taikhana2.git


************#####when locally commiting after adding file to git#######***************
git pull --rebase origin master
git push origin master
Explanation:
That way, you would replay (the --rebase part) your local commits on top of the newly updated origin/master 
(or origin/yourBranch: git pull origin yourBranch).
See a more complete example in the chapter 6 Pull with rebase of the Git Pocket Book.


Step to push a file to github directory------>
git push -u origin master

to clone-
git clone sshurl


****once we create a new repository we get only one branch and it is main branch called as master

##in order to create a new branch---(******this creates an exact copy of the master branch will all the files in it)
git branch "branch-name"

##to switch to this branch---
git checkout "branch-name"


###to merge this branch into the master branch
go to master branch like 
git checkout master
then->
git merge "branch-name"(which one u want to merge)
now to delete this merged branch
type->git branch -D "branch-name"




to check log(commit history)-
git log

to create more decriptive graph of the commit history-
git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph

to give a name to this command-
alias graph="git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph"

then directly we can use this command 


what is forking?
forking means to create exact replica/instance of the master branch from the repository of some other account

What is pull request?
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. 
Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications,
and even push follow-up commits if necessary.

git stashing------------------------------------------------------>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
a. to remove the modifications from the current branch but to store someplace to reuse it later
git stash

b. to reuse the changes----->
git stash pop/apply

c. difference b/w pop and apply----->
git stash pop throws away the (topmost, by default) stash after applying it, whereas git stash apply leaves it in 
the stash list for possible later reuse (or you can then git stash drop it).

This happens unless there are conflicts after git stash pop, in this case, it will not remove the stash,
behaving exactly like git stash apply.

Another way to look at it: git stash pop is git stash apply && git stash drop.
